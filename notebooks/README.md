Note on contents of `notebooks`  

I tend to use Jupyter Notebooks as initial scratch-paper for coding ideas and then rapidly shift over to writing python `driver` scripts (e.g., `PNSN_src/drivers/preprocess/characterize_split_data.py`) that can be run either from
the command line, or more often in an `ipython` instance with the `%matplotlib` "magic" command run for interactive plotting.  

Long way of saying, the notebooks here are incomplete and should not be viewed as the definitive versions of any code.
